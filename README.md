## Nadu Barbashova 

I'm PhD student in Psychological & Brain Sciences @ UCSB  
I study fear, cognition, and metacognition â€” integrating behavioral, physiological, and fMRI methods.

I am also interested in future oriented cognition and how we engage emotional and cognitive processes to confront challenges that occur at various levels of construal (both concrete and abstract problems). 

As humans we are unique in our ability to simulate future and uncertain events and to be affected by the hypothetical.
